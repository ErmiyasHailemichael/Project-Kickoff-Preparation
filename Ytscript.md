## 🎬 Project Kickoff Video Script

**[Introduction – 20 seconds]** 👋

Hello everyone, my name is Ermiyas. Today, I'll be presenting the kickoff plan for my project, the **Student Resource Navigator Mobile App**.

**[Project Overview – 30 seconds]** 📱

The purpose of this app is to help college students easily access academic, health, and social services through a centralized mobile platform. Our goal is to increase student access to important campus resources with a simple and user-friendly mobile app.

**[Project Team and Stakeholders – 30 seconds]** 👥

The project team includes a developer, a designer, a content coordinator, and a QA tester. Our key stakeholders are students, the Student Services Office, and the Academic Advising Office.

**[Project Scope and Deliverables – 45 seconds]** 📦

The main scope of the project includes building the mobile app with search and browse functionality, push notifications, and an analytics dashboard. Out of scope for now are features like appointment booking or chatbot integrations. Our key deliverables are the mobile app itself, an admin dashboard, and marketing materials.

**[Timeline and Milestones – 45 seconds]** 🗓️

We are aiming for a 12-week timeline. Key milestones include finalizing requirements, completing design wireframes, developing the MVP, conducting user testing, and launching the app. Weekly status updates and bi-weekly standups will help keep the project on track.

**[Risk Management and Success Metrics – 1 minute]** ⚡

Potential risks include delays in app store approvals, scope creep, and low user engagement. To manage these risks, we’ll use a risk log and regular team check-ins. Success will be measured by achieving 500+ downloads, a 4.5+ star rating in the app store, and over 85% user satisfaction in surveys.

**[Next Steps – 30 seconds]** 🚀

Our immediate next steps are confirming final team members, gathering resource content, and scheduling our first sprint meeting.

Thank you for watching my project kickoff presentation. I'm excited to bring this project to life and create a resource that will help students thrive!
